                <p id ="box"><br><br>☛Swami Vivekananda(12 January 1863 – 4 July 1902), born Narendranath Datta 
                    was an Indian Hindu monk,
                    philosopher, author, religious teacher, and the chief disciple of the 
                    Indian mystic Ramakrishna.<br><br>
                    ☛He was a key figure in the introduction of Vedanta and Yoga to the  world 
                   and is credited with raising 
                   interfaith awareness, and bringing Hinduism to the status of a major world 
                   religion.<br><br>
                   ☛Vivekananda became a popular figure after the 1893 Parliament of Religions 
                   in Chicago, where he began his famous 
                   speech with the words, "Sisters and brothers of America...," before 
                   introducing Hinduism to Americans.<br><br>
                   ☛He was so impactful at the Parliament that an American newspaper described him 
                    as: “an orator by divine right 
                    and undoubtedly the greatest figure at the Parliament”.<br><br>
                    ☛After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda 
                    delivered hundreds of lectures across
                   the United States, England and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu 
                   philosophy<br><br>☛He founded the 
                   Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco 
                   (now Vedanta Society of Northern California),
                   both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West.<br><br>
                   ☛In the background of emerging nationalism in British-ruled India, Vivekananda 
                   crystallised the nationalistic ideal.<br><br> 
                   ☛In the words of social reformer Charles Freer Andrews, 
                   "The Swami's intrepid patriotism gave a new colour to the national movement throughout India. 
                   More than any other single individual of that period Vivekananda had made his contribution to 
                   the new awakening of India"</p>
